# This is where you'll have to manually insert information about the videos you'll be extracting frames from.
# I know, it's tedious, but ffprobe is too slow for my needs. If I find something faster, I'll replace this with that. I swear.
# Fill in information about the movies you'll be posting, then rename this file to movies.toml
# DO NOT PUSH THE FINISHED FILE TO THE REPO! It's not as much a security risk as with secrets.py, but it would still suck.
# I'll go over every individual veriable here:
# filename - Movie filename
# filmframes - Number of frames in the file
# filmname - Name of film
# framerate - Framerate, provided as a fraction
# filmhdr - Whether the video uses HDR or not
# filmcroptb - The total number of pixels to crop from the top and bottom combined (for letterboxed videos)
# filmcroplr - The total number of pixels to crop from the left and right combined (for letterboxed videos)
# filmnopost - Ranges of frames where the script should not post from. Should be a list of nested lists consisting of [start, end] frames in range of frames that should not be posted, inclusive.

# The following is an example of a toml file that might be used on my own bot:
#
# [0]
# filename = 'movie0.mkv'
# filmframes = 168072
# filmname = "Into The Spider-Verse"
# framerate = '24000/1001'
# filmhdr = true
# filmcroptb = 552
# filmcroplr = 0
# filmnopost = [[1,1538], [1593,1638], [1710,1757],[1789,1829],[151630,151693],[156011,166125],[167856,168072]]
# [1]
# filename = 'movie1.mkv'
# filmframes = 146856
# filmname = "NBC Mystery Movie"
# framerate = '24000/1001'
# filmhdr = false
# filmcroptb = 0
# filmcroplr = 0
# filmnopost = []
#
# NOTE: When invoking frameposter.py, you'll be using the value in the brackets as your argument to select a film.
