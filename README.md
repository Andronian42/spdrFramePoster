# spidrvrsebot
A dead-simple Python script for posting frames to a Twitter account. Used on [@SpidrVrseFrames](twitter.com/spidrVrseFrames).
## WARNING:
This script comes with no warranty, and no promise of quality. This project is poorly coded, and it'll likely stay that way.  
The code in this repository is the "old" version of the script. A newer version more well-coded and accepting of multiple videos will be released soon.
## Usage
### Dependencies
- Python 3\.*
- [python-twitter](https://pypi.org/project/python-twitter/)
- [python-ffmpeg](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg-python/)
### Setup
Clone repository to any directory, 
### Result
Script extracts and posts one frame from video file spiderverse.mp4, which is expected to be cut into a video of 155751 frames (this will be handled better in the newer version). Run on a schedule using cron or a similar scheduling program.
